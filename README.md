# Engine

Generic core of any application or runtime. This is Scratch for adults.

## Story

Last decades we've been in a loop of reinventing the same kind of interfaces for our applications and runtimes. It's all text driven. REPL consoles for our terminals, IDEs being fancy text editors enriched with bloated toolchains because they always have to translate everything back to text. Debuggers seem to break loose from this concept the best.

What if we start from the concept of a debugger? We return to the roots of an application and try to rediscover the way we've been interfacing with technology for good.

Someone must've tried this before, right? I can't find an example. It's about time we provide a generic interface compatible with any digital input without starting from the concept of a single input and output stream.

Yes, this will probably not reach the goal of pushing us to the next step of evolution in programming, but I like the idea.
